## Outline: will iteratively write this

It is important to be mindful of your mindset, but what does that mean?

I think it means to be aware of ones self, through reflection. To reflect upon your self and how you react or interact with your environment whilst being aware of ones own mental state as much as that is possible. It helps to have some language to both think and at times communicate with others about this.

In the context of mindset, I want to utilize the words precision, accuracy, adiabaticity, and externalities in a particular way. Precision being that which is self-consistent but not absolute, this because of Godel's incompleteness theorem. Accuracy, being practically limited to what is known, and so perhaps ultimately unknowable if all things are relative. However, I do think accuracy, even with its scope limited in practice, best be ground in the concept of adiabaticity and used as one integration point between systems. Externalities being things not yet integrated into a precision system or system(s), and also being part of the unknowns when considered from the perspective of accuracy.

Given those few words meanings in this context, I would then describe different modes of being. Not that they are mutually exclusive as surely some blend of them will be motivating your interactions. Here I will add the terms precision-flow, and discovery-mode. The first precision-flow, describing activity that is aligned with a precision system, perhaps the construction of theory from lemmas given some priori, albeit that is quite a formal example and precision-flow activities needn't be that strict. The latter discovery-mode for activities which intend to discover and integrate externalities.

Discovery-mode heavy activity is likely to lead to extensions to existing models and/or theories, or lead to increases in awareness necessitating refactoring of existing systems, re-quantization of existing systems, or the development of new models.

On the other hand precision-flow activities are focused on building out systems without reconsidering the priori.

A socio-ecologico-economic system; a modern one, a mixture of individual human activity, social activity, and computer and/or other systems, including environmental system mediated activity. From the monetary system, both implicitly and explicitly, value chains emerge. I find it better to think of them as graphs. Where nodes represent either people or systems, and the edges transactions and/or interactions. From this perspective I want to consider transactions holistically, meaning that it is not just the exchange of currency, but also the communications, interactions, and utilization of tools and/or systems including markets. Let's start with two different graph representations for a system. One shows the possible transactions between nodes without respect to time, and another shows transactions ordered by time, and for the purpose of visualization imagine these stacked vertically when they are coincident in time. This stacking often requiring replication of nodes in the non-time domain representation, where-as without time-alignment such node replication is not necessary or desired.

Thinking of the time ordered graph, a node representing a human or non-human system, let's say a human. The human will be in some mindset, more generally they will have both a mental context, and a physical situation or context, not that these contexts are disjoint. However each perspective is efficient for different sorts of analysis. Furthermore as you zoom in or out on either, there are specialized fields for the analysis of subsystems.

An interaction may involve no or several people. In the first case it may be an autonomous computer system making a scheduled transaction, or physical system such as a gas diffusing throughout a vacuum chamber. In the case of a human system, it could be a group of people in a technical conference, and of course there are many other scenarios, each with a different graph representation of the relationships. Without too much digression, there are also relationships between the sub-components of each of the people, most of which we do not yet understand well. Subsystem mapping projects include the human genome, metabolome, and connectome projects among others. Those aside for now.

Depending on the intent of the interaction, there may be one or more specialized dialects used for interaction. Each participant too will have their own word meaning, as meaning is defined by relations and these too are dynamic, being effected by history, environmental setting, mindset generally, and concepts like priming words or narratives.

To simplify the above, imagine a multidisciplinary team. Each expert likely has either his own words, or at least his own word meanings as compared to others use of words in context. Furthermore the intents of each of the participants is not fully known. There may also be process language, that is language specific to the intended interaction, and again each individual may have a role or role(s) that effect which subset(s) of this process language are used. Beyond that there is language used outside of the process in order to change the process or communicate ones sentiment regarding the process or perhaps a situation that is on their mind at the time, relevant or not to the process at hand. From this perspective you have in-process communications which perhaps have some consistency in their efficiency but might cause diffuse issues to participants that may or may not cross the threshold of making them uncomfortable. Then out-of-process communication which may be non-process related entirely or perhaps is intended to re-negotiate the process itself.

If one could utilize linguistic analysis to annotate conversations and weight speech with in-process and out-of-process mixtures along with further labels denoting sentiment and other things, then one might be able to with a large corpus of process conversations somewhat quantify the effectiveness of various communication strategies. Effectiveness could be measured in many ways, for example: process efficiency over some time period, participant sentiment, participant development (future value), and process delta and/or beta, among other properties.
