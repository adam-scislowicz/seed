NOTE: Bold isn't working well in the markdown preview. Perhaps I need to list the bold variant of the font in the font list associated with markdown preview or use a different font.

### Singleton

The singleton pattern refers to a situation where you wan't just one instance of a given object.

## Abstract Factory

**Also Known As**: [kit]

**Intent**: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete class.

**Conventions**: Often the suffix `Kit` is used to denote an Abstract Factory type class. e.g. UIWidgetKit.
