# extropic.net

This sub-project helps maintain the extropic.net domain and its primary services such as dns, email, and a web server.

TODO:

- extend the core.cf.yaml to include an IAM role with the minimum permissions necessary to manage all stacks for aws extropic.net. Divide into multiple roles when necessary. Check the IAM video and other resources for the necessary information.
